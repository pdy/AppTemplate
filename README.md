Utility that serves me as starting point whenever I need to write small tool or when learning new library or technique.

# Build

Makefiles are linux only. Tools you need:
* clang++ with c++17 support

If you'll use my script, app is easy to prepare

````
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdy/scripts/master/utils/napp.sh
$ sh napp.sh StartApp
$ cd StartApp
$ make
````
Then enter 'build' directory to access binaries.
